# YNABunq

Pushes [Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/) transactions into a [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) account.

YNAB didn't support syncing from Bunq natively so I just did it myself :^)

This is currently for my own personal use, but if I decide to polish it enough I'll write up how to use it here.
